I have tested a lot of models, but not all. So I cannot be sure yet that the new exploits work on all models. It is possible that some models have modified bootloaders which may not be compatible. When a phone turns out to be incompatible when trying to unlock it, it will end up in Flash mode, and it will not be able to boot the OS anymore. In this case it will always be possible to flash a stock ROM to get the phone booting again. Here is a list which shows what Bootloader Spec was used for different Lumia models. It also shows which OS versions are supported for enabling Root Access."/>
